## SimpleWebServer

### Description

This is a Simple Webserver Program, which accepts requests from Internet Explorer. Really, some of you could'nt have imagined to make Internet Explorer as client. The Application has a round circle shape interface, made this using api,and also animates according to request from Internet Explorer.I am not sure whether the actual Web server works as this. This Application provides a greater scope on reading Header information from Internet Explorer. You can never leave the application without rating as excellent.Readme file also included.

Note: Run the server, open the IE and type the URL as http://localhost:1001/server.html to access an html page,

Type http://localhost:1001/ANIMATE to Animate the form

Type http://localhost:1001/STOP to stop the Animation

You need to have Microsoft Winsock control and Scripting run time library.
