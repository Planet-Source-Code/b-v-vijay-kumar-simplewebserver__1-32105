This is a demonstration of making IE as a client
for our socket program.

I have Provided necessary files, even a sample html file
you need to have Microsoft Winsock Control,and scripting library
to run this application

Once you start the server, open Internet Explorer, and type the 
URL as follows 
http://mymachinename:1001/server.html, here myservername should be the
name of your system, or just type http:/localhost:1001/server.html

Note:This server listens on port 1001, so be sure to type the port as
1001

If you want to animate the form at server, type 
http://myservername:1001/ANIMATE,

TO Stop the animation just type http://myservername:1001/STOP
